            <h4 id="Wearable">It Was A Wearable Game</h4>
            <p id="JacketP1">The goal for this project was to make a jacket that could be used for a playground game called "Ninja". The rules of Ninja are simple, two or more players face each other and then take turns trying to use their hands to hit another player's arm between the shoulder and the wrist. A point is scored when a player lands a hit on another player.<br><br> Our jacket was able to sense hits to the arms of the wearer and used sound and lights to communicate when and where the player's arm was hit.<br><br> For this project, I took lead on the hardware aspect, while also helping a bit with the code.</p>
