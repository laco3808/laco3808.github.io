        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p id="AboutP">My passion is redesigning everyday occurrences into fun experiences. I enjoy challenging myself and am a tenacious problem solver. I love designing gadgets and gizmos for my friends as mischievous reflections of their personalities. My favorite way to express myself is through creating physical objects as a way to both stay out of my head during the creative process and also connect with the physical world.</p>
